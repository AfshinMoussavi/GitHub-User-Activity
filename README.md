# GitHub User Activity

This project fetches and displays GitHub user activity events using the GitHub API. It allows users to input a GitHub username, retrieve their recent activity events, filter these events by type (e.g., PushEvent, WatchEvent), and display them in a visually appealing, color-coded format.

## Features:
- **Fetch Activity Events:** Retrieve recent activity events for any GitHub user by their username.
- **Event Filtering:** Filter events based on their type (e.g., CreateEvent, PushEvent, DeleteEvent, WatchEvent).
- **Formatted Output:** Display the fetched activities in a color-coded box with event details, including the repository name, event type, and event creation date.
- **Error Handling:** Proper handling of common errors such as invalid usernames or network connection issues.
